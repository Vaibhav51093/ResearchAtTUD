This repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and shell scripts for preprocessing and post-processing simulation data, data creation and analysis, and running simulations on an HPC cluster. 
Additionally, it includes machine learning workflows aimed at mimicking classical interatomic potentials for MD simulations, enabling data-driven approaches to simulation tasks and predictive modeling.
