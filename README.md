This repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and shell scripts for preprocessing and post-processing simulation data, data creation and analysis, and running simulations on an HPC cluster. 
Additionally, it includes machine learning workflows aimed at mimicking Pedone interatomic potentials, enabling data-driven approaches to simulation tasks and predictive modeling.
